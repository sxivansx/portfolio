## Overview

**Vertex** is the official student club of the Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering Department at DSCE, supporting initiatives across technology, culture, and sports. This project explores a comprehensive design language—from conceptual logo work to scalable digital assets.

## Highlights

- **Logo Design with Purpose**: Crafted a dynamic logo inspired by the geometric form of a vertex — representing intersection, data flow, and connectivity — that adapts across posters, stamps, web, and print.
- **Unified Visual System**: Developed a cohesive design language reflecting tech, communication, and collaboration using node-based layouts, gradients, and modular grids.
- **Responsive Landing Page**: Designed a clean, intuitive landing page showcasing events, club mission, and team highlights, with sections for gallery, event cards, and founder intros.

## Tools Used

- **Figma**: UI design, layout structure, and style guide components.
- **Illustrator**: Logo system, poster artwork, and vector assets.
- **Photoshop**: Mockups and image compositions for presentation.

## Outcome

The Vertex design ecosystem brought identity and consistency to the club's digital presence. From web to wall posters, every touchpoint reinforces the club's core — energetic, connected, and future-ready.
