## Project Overview

**NexTribe** is a mobile platform designed to help users discover and connect with offline-focused communities near them—from jam sessions and design clubs to social impact groups and college meetups. This case study captures the end-to-end work done from scratch, including **branding, logo design, UI/UX, promotional materials, and a product showcase video**.

The goal was to design a digital space that feels welcoming yet purposeful—bringing people together through shared interests and local events.

## Highlights

- **Complete Brand Design**  
  Designed the full visual identity of NexTribe, including logo, typography, color palette, and iconography with a community-focused feel.

- **Mobile App UI/UX**  
  Built intuitive, locality-based flows for users to browse events, explore communities, and personalize profiles with a clean, engaging layout.

- **Promotional Mockups & Ads**  
  Created high-impact promotional creatives and real-world ad mockups—like metro station billboards—to simulate campaign rollout.

- **App Showcasing Video**  
  Designed and edited a project video to showcase the UI, animations, and brand tone in motion.

## Tools & Process

- **Figma** – UI design, wireframes, branding system, mobile layouts, and screen flows  
- **Adobe Illustrator** – Logo and branding asset design  
- **Adobe Photoshop** – Mockup creation, promotional ads, and visual enhancements  
- **After Effects** – App showcase video editing and motion pacing

## Insights & Reflections

The challenge was balancing community depth with simplicity—ensuring users could engage with meaningful groups while navigating effortlessly. The branding needed to feel versatile, yet youthful and bold enough to represent a wide range of communities.

This project reflects a holistic approach to product design—where brand and interface come together to tell one story.

## Results

NexTribe’s complete design system—from logo to launch visuals—was built from scratch to simulate a real-world MVP. The visual identity, UI, and marketing material work in harmony to pitch NexTribe as a scalable, community-powered app with real social potential.
