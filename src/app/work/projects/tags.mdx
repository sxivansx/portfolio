## Project Overview

**GPay Tags** is a feature concept designed to bring more clarity and control to digital payments. It introduces a simple yet powerful **tagging system** inside Google Pay, allowing users to group transactions by context—like *“Trip to Goa”*, *“Flat Rent”*, or *“College Fest”*—for better tracking and shared expense management.

This case study explores the full journey from identifying user pain points to designing a scalable solution that fits naturally into GPay’s ecosystem.

## Highlights

- **Intuitive Tagging System**  
  Designed a contextual tagging layer over existing transactions to help users filter, organize, and recall expenses with ease—without disrupting the familiar GPay flow.

- **UX Research & Problem Framing**  
  Based on real-world struggles like splitting bills, reconciling spends, and remembering transaction intent. Mapped key friction points across the user journey.

- **Minimal, Modular UI Design**  
  Created clean, native-feeling interfaces with micro-interactions and an inline tagging experience. Included entry-points during send/receive and from the transaction history.

- **Real-World Use Cases**  
  Validated with scenarios like group travel, monthly rents, college events, and gift collections—making it easy to track who paid what, and why.

## Tools & Process

- **Figma** – UX flow mapping, wireframes, UI components, and final visuals  

## Insights & Reflections

Designing inside an existing product taught the value of **constraint-led creativity**. Instead of redesigning the wheel, the solution adds just enough value to make a big difference—especially in collaborative or recurring payment situations.

The feature blends user needs with business impact by improving **clarity, retention, and feature engagement** within the app.

## Results

The project gained traction as a concept UX improvement for fintech apps. It's a scalable feature idea that can enhance trust, usability, and spending transparency—while requiring minimal engineering overhead to implement.
